# -Using-AWS-DevOps-tools-for-CI-CD-pipeline-automations

Project Overview
The project involved the creation of an AWS release pipeline utilizing AWS CodePipeline, along with other AWS DevOps tools. The pipeline was designed to facilitate the continuous integration and delivery of a demo calculator web application, addressing the need for faster and more reliable deployments.

Existing Resources
AWS CloudFormation: Used to define and provision the infrastructure for the release pipeline and the Multi-AZ cloud environment.
AWS CodeCommit: Hosted the repository where the web application code was stored.
AWS Lambda: Defined functions for testing and validating the pipeline stages.
Project Objectives
By the completion of this project, the following objectives were achieved:

Understanding Release Pipeline Architecture:

Gained insights into the components and workflow of an AWS release pipeline.
Troubleshooting Pipeline Failures:

Identified and resolved issues causing failures in the AWS CodePipeline, particularly during the build stage.
Adjusting Infrastructure Configurations:

Modified AWS infrastructure configurations based on testing outcomes from the pipeline.
Validating and Approving Code Changes:

Implemented manual approval processes for changes between pipeline stages to ensure quality control.
Adding Actions to Pipeline Stages:

Enhanced the existing AWS CodePipeline by incorporating additional actions to improve automation.
Monitoring with AWS X-Ray:

Utilized AWS X-Ray to trace events from AWS Lambda functions, aiding in debugging and performance optimization.
